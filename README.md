# Hand-Written digits classifier
Build and train CNN model using Relu activation function in hidden layer and
Softmax activation function in output layer in Keras , such that Model classify the given image of handwritten digit into one of 10 classes, representing integer values between 0 to 9, inclusively. MNIST dataset contains 70,000 small square 28 x 28 pixel grayscale images. Number of parameters used 93322 and relu activation function used model gives 99.4% training accuracy and 99.3% test accuracy.
